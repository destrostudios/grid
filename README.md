# Grid
A turn-based tactical game, where different teams fight each other on a grid.

## How to start the client locally
- Create a directory `workspace` in the root directory of this project
- Create a file `assets.ini` in that directory, that contains the relative path pointing to the `assets` directory (`../assets/`)
- Start the `com.destrostudios.grid.client.Main` class with `workspace` as working directory
